# BioRSP – Biological Radar Scanning Plot

BioRSP is a tool designed for analyzing scRNA-seq gene expression data. It complements dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE and UMAP by providing robust spatial embedding pattern analysis and visualization capabilities. BioRSP offers a detailed interpretation of embedding spaces with both qualitative visualizations and quantitative metrics, making it a valuable resource for preclinical and translational research.
